# Encryption-code-website
- Website of Encryption code
- right now downloading works
- everything else works
- I am trying to make it so that there is an Encryptor in the website.
  - I could make a Encryptor a translator somewhere and then embed it into the website.
- Right now the site is a google site, at some point I want to make it Encryptioncode.com but idk i'll have to pay for the domain if i do that.
- I might also change it to wixsite because I think it has more features
